BUNDLE-UPDATE(1)					      BUNDLE-UPDATE(1)



1mNAME0m
       1mbundle-update 22m- Update your gems to the latest available versions

1mSYNOPSIS0m
       1mbundle update 4m22m*gems24m [--group=NAME] [--source=NAME] [--local] [--ruby]

1mDESCRIPTION0m
       Update  the  gems specified (all gems, if none are specified), ignoring
       the previously installed gems specified in the  1mGemfile.lock22m.  In  gen-
       eral, you should use bundle install(1) 4mbundle-install.1.html24m to install
       the same exact gems and versions across machines.

       You would use 1mbundle update 22mto explicitly update the version of a gem.

1mOPTIONS0m
       1m--group=<name>0m
	      Only update the gems in the specified group. For	instance,  you
	      can  update all gems in the development group with 1mbundle update0m
	      1m--group development22m. You  can  also	call  1mbundle	update	rails0m
	      1m--group  test  22mto  update the rails gem and all gems in the test
	      group, for example.

       1m--source=<name>0m
	      The name of a 1m:git 22mor 1m:path 22msource used in the	Gemfile(5).  For
	      instance,        with	   a	    1m:git	 22msource	 of
	      1mhttp://github.com/rails/rails.git22m, you would call 1mbundle  update0m
	      1m--source rails0m

       1m--local0m
	      Do  not  attempt	to  fetch  gems remotely and use the gem cache
	      instead.

       1m--ruby 22mUpdate the locked version of Ruby  to  the  current	version  of
	      Ruby.

       1m--bundler0m
	      Update the locked version of bundler to the invoked bundler ver-
	      sion.

1mUPDATING ALL GEMS0m
       If you run 1mbundle update 22mwith no parameters, bundler  will	ignore	any
       previously  installed  gems and resolve all dependencies again based on
       the latest versions of all gems available in the sources.

       Consider the following Gemfile(5):



	   source "https://rubygems.org"

	   gem "rails", "3.0.0.rc"
	   gem "nokogiri"



       When you run bundle install(1) 4mbundle-install.1.html24m  the  first  time,
       bundler	will  resolve  all  of the dependencies, all the way down, and
       install what you need:



	   Fetching gem metadata from https://rubygems.org/.........
	   Resolving dependencies...
	   Installing builder 2.1.2
	   Installing abstract 1.0.0
	   Installing rack 1.2.8
	   Using bundler 1.7.6
	   Installing rake 10.4.0
	   Installing polyglot 0.3.5
	   Installing mime-types 1.25.1
	   Installing i18n 0.4.2
	   Installing mini_portile 0.6.1
	   Installing tzinfo 0.3.42
	   Installing rack-mount 0.6.14
	   Installing rack-test 0.5.7
	   Installing treetop 1.4.15
	   Installing thor 0.14.6
	   Installing activesupport 3.0.0.rc
	   Installing erubis 2.6.6
	   Installing activemodel 3.0.0.rc
	   Installing arel 0.4.0
	   Installing mail 2.2.20
	   Installing activeresource 3.0.0.rc
	   Installing actionpack 3.0.0.rc
	   Installing activerecord 3.0.0.rc
	   Installing actionmailer 3.0.0.rc
	   Installing railties 3.0.0.rc
	   Installing rails 3.0.0.rc
	   Installing nokogiri 1.6.5

	   Bundle complete! 2 Gemfile dependencies, 26 gems total.
	   Use `bundle show [gemname]` to see where a bundled gem is installed.



       As you can see, even though you have two gems in the  Gemfile(5),  your
       application  needs 26 different gems in order to run. Bundler remembers
       the exact versions it installed in 1mGemfile.lock22m. The next time you	run
       bundle  install(1)  4mbundle-install.1.html24m, bundler skips the dependency
       resolution and installs the same gems as it installed last time.

       After checking in the 1mGemfile.lock 22minto version control and cloning  it
       on  another  machine,  running  bundle install(1) 4mbundle-install.1.html0m
       will 4mstill24m install the gems that you installed  last  time.  You  don't
       need to worry that a new release of 1merubis 22mor 1mmail 22mchanges the gems you
       use.

       However, from time to time, you might want to update the gems  you  are
       using  to  the  newest  versions that still match the gems in your Gem-
       file(5).

       To do this, run 1mbundle update22m, which will ignore the 1mGemfile.lock22m,  and
       resolve	all the dependencies again. Keep in mind that this process can
       result in a significantly different set of the 25 gems,	based  on  the
       requirements  of  new gems that the gem authors released since the last
       time you ran 1mbundle update22m.

1mUPDATING A LIST OF GEMS0m
       Sometimes, you want to update a single gem in the Gemfile(5), and leave
       the  rest  of the gems that you specified locked to the versions in the
       1mGemfile.lock22m.

       For instance, in the scenario above,  imagine  that  1mnokogiri	22mreleases
       version 1m1.4.422m, and you want to update it 4mwithout24m updating Rails and all
       of its dependencies. To do this, run 1mbundle update nokogiri22m.

       Bundler will update 1mnokogiri 22mand any of  its  dependencies,  but  leave
       alone Rails and its dependencies.

1mOVERLAPPING DEPENDENCIES0m
       Sometimes,  multiple  gems declared in your Gemfile(5) are satisfied by
       the same second-level dependency. For instance, consider  the  case  of
       1mthin 22mand 1mrack-perftools-profiler22m.



	   source "https://rubygems.org"

	   gem "thin"
	   gem "rack-perftools-profiler"



       The  1mthin  22mgem  depends  on  1mrack >= 1.022m, while 1mrack-perftools-profiler0m
       depends on 1mrack ~> 1.022m. If you run bundle install, you get:



	   Fetching source index for https://rubygems.org/
	   Installing daemons (1.1.0)
	   Installing eventmachine (0.12.10) with native extensions
	   Installing open4 (1.0.1)
	   Installing perftools.rb (0.4.7) with native extensions
	   Installing rack (1.2.1)
	   Installing rack-perftools_profiler (0.0.2)
	   Installing thin (1.2.7) with native extensions
	   Using bundler (1.0.0.rc.3)



       In this case, the two gems have their own set of dependencies, but they
       share  1mrack  22min  common.  If  you  run 1mbundle update thin22m, bundler will
       update 1mdaemons22m, 1meventmachine 22mand 1mrack22m, which are dependencies of	1mthin22m,
       but   not   1mopen4   22mor   1mperftools.rb22m,   which   are	dependencies  of
       1mrack-perftools_profiler22m. Note that 1mbundle update thin 22mwill update  1mrack0m
       even though it's 4malso24m a dependency of 1mrack-perftools_profiler22m.

       1mIn  short22m,	when  you  update  a  gem using 1mbundle update22m, bundler will
       update all dependencies of that gem,  including	those  that  are  also
       dependencies of another gem.

       In this scenario, updating the 1mthin 22mversion manually in the Gemfile(5),
       and then running  bundle  install(1)  4mbundle-install.1.html24m  will  only
       update  1mdaemons  22mand  1meventmachine22m, but not 1mrack22m. For more information,
       see  the  1mCONSERVATIVE  UPDATING  22msection  of  bundle  install(1)  4mbun-0m
       4mdle-install.1.html24m.

1mRECOMMENDED WORKFLOW0m
       In  general, when working with an application managed with bundler, you
       should use the following workflow:

       o   After you create your Gemfile(5) for the first time, run

	   $ bundle install

       o   Check the resulting 1mGemfile.lock 22minto version control

	   $ git add Gemfile.lock

       o   When checking out this repository on another  development  machine,
	   run

	   $ bundle install

       o   When checking out this repository on a deployment machine, run

	   $ bundle install --deployment

       o   After  changing  the  Gemfile(5)  to reflect a new or update depen-
	   dency, run

	   $ bundle install

       o   Make sure to check the updated 1mGemfile.lock 22minto version control

	   $ git add Gemfile.lock

       o   If bundle install(1) 4mbundle-install.1.html24m reports a conflict, man-
	   ually update the specific gems that you changed in the Gemfile(5)

	   $ bundle update rails thin

       o   If  you want to update all the gems to the latest possible versions
	   that still match the gems listed in the Gemfile(5), run

	   $ bundle update
