.TH "BUNDLE\-CONFIG" "1" "October 2016" "" ""
.
.SH "NAME"
\fBbundle\-config\fR \- Set bundler configuration options
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBbundle config\fR [\fIname\fR [\fIvalue\fR]]
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This command allows you to interact with bundler\'s configuration system\. Bundler retrieves its configuration from the local application (\fBapp/\.bundle/config\fR), environment variables, and the user\'s home directory (\fB~/\.bundle/config\fR), in that order of priority\.
.
.P
Executing \fBbundle config\fR with no parameters will print a list of all bundler configuration for the current bundle, and where that configuration was set\.
.
.P
Executing \fBbundle config <name>\fR will print the value of that configuration setting, and where it was set\.
.
.P
Executing \fBbundle config <name> <value>\fR will set that configuration to the value specified for all bundles executed as the current user\. The configuration will be stored in \fB~/\.bundle/config\fR\. If \fIname\fR already is set, \fIname\fR will be overridden and user will be warned\.
.
.P
Executing \fBbundle config \-\-global <name> <value>\fR works the same as above\.
.
.P
Executing \fBbundle config \-\-local <name> <value>\fR will set that configuration to the local application\. The configuration will be stored in \fBapp/\.bundle/config\fR\.
.
.P
Executing \fBbundle config \-\-delete <name>\fR will delete the configuration in both local and global sources\. Not compatible with \-\-global or \-\-local flag\.
.
.P
Executing bundle with the \fBBUNDLE_IGNORE_CONFIG\fR environment variable set will cause it to ignore all configuration\.
.
.P
Executing \fBbundle config disable_multisource true\fR upgrades the warning about the Gemfile containing multiple primary sources to an error\. Executing \fBbundle config \-\-delete disable_multisource\fR downgrades this error to a warning\.
.
.SH "REMEMBERING OPTIONS"
Flags passed to \fBbundle install\fR or the Bundler runtime, such as \fB\-\-path foo\fR or \fB\-\-without production\fR, are not remembered between commands\. If these options must be remembered,they must be set using \fBbundle config\fR (e\.g\., \fBbundle config path foo\fR)\.
.
.P
The options that can be configured are:
.
.TP
\fBbinstubs\fR
Creates a directory (defaults to \fB~/bin\fR) and place any executables from the gem there\. These executables run in Bundler\'s context\. If used, you might add this directory to your environment\'s \fBPATH\fR variable\. For instance, if the \fBrails\fR gem comes with a \fBrails\fR executable, this flag will create a \fBbin/rails\fR executable that ensures that all referred dependencies will be resolved using the bundled gems\.
.
.TP
\fBdeployment\fR
In deployment mode, Bundler will \'roll\-out\' the bundle for \fBproduction\fR use\. Please check carefully if you want to have this option enabled in \fBdevelopment\fR or \fBtest\fR environments\.
.
.TP
\fBpath\fR
The location to install the specified gems to\. This defaults to Rubygems\' setting\. Bundler shares this location with Rubygems, \fBgem install \.\.\.\fR will have gem installed there, too\. Therefore, gems installed without a \fB\-\-path \.\.\.\fR setting will show up by calling \fBgem list\fR\. Accodingly, gems installed to other locations will not get listed\.
.
.TP
\fBwithout\fR
A space\-separated list of groups referencing gems to skip during installation\.
.
.SH "BUILD OPTIONS"
You can use \fBbundle config\fR to give bundler the flags to pass to the gem installer every time bundler tries to install a particular gem\.
.
.P
A very common example, the \fBmysql\fR gem, requires Snow Leopard users to pass configuration flags to \fBgem install\fR to specify where to find the \fBmysql_config\fR executable\.
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

gem install mysql \-\- \-\-with\-mysql\-config=/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql_config
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
Since the specific location of that executable can change from machine to machine, you can specify these flags on a per\-machine basis\.
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

bundle config build\.mysql \-\-with\-mysql\-config=/usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql_config
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
After running this command, every time bundler needs to install the \fBmysql\fR gem, it will pass along the flags you specified\.
.
.SH "CONFIGURATION KEYS"
Configuration keys in bundler have two forms: the canonical form and the environment variable form\.
.
.P
For instance, passing the \fB\-\-without\fR flag to bundle install(1) \fIbundle\-install\.1\.html\fR prevents Bundler from installing certain groups specified in the Gemfile(5)\. Bundler persists this value in \fBapp/\.bundle/config\fR so that calls to \fBBundler\.setup\fR do not try to find gems from the \fBGemfile\fR that you didn\'t install\. Additionally, subsequent calls to bundle install(1) \fIbundle\-install\.1\.html\fR remember this setting and skip those groups\.
.
.P
The canonical form of this configuration is \fB"without"\fR\. To convert the canonical form to the environment variable form, capitalize it, and prepend \fBBUNDLE_\fR\. The environment variable form of \fB"without"\fR is \fBBUNDLE_WITHOUT\fR\.
.
.P
Any periods in the configuration keys must be replaced with two underscores when setting it via environment variables\. The configuration key \fBlocal\.rack\fR becomes the environment variable \fBBUNDLE_LOCAL__RACK\fR\.
.
.SH "LIST OF AVAILABLE KEYS"
The following is a list of all configuration keys and their purpose\. You can learn more about their operation in bundle install(1) \fIbundle\-install\.1\.html\fR\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBpath\fR (\fBBUNDLE_PATH\fR): The location on disk where all gems in your bundle will be located regardless of \fB$GEM_HOME\fR or \fB$GEM_PATH\fR values\. Bundle gems not found in this location will be installed by \fBbundle install\fR\. Defaults to \fBGem\.dir\fR\. When \-\-deployment is used, defaults to vendor/bundle\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBfrozen\fR (\fBBUNDLE_FROZEN\fR): Disallow changes to the \fBGemfile\fR\. Defaults to \fBtrue\fR when \fB\-\-deployment\fR is used\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBwithout\fR (\fBBUNDLE_WITHOUT\fR): A \fB:\fR\-separated list of groups whose gems bundler should not install
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBbin\fR (\fBBUNDLE_BIN\fR): Install executables from gems in the bundle to the specified directory\. Defaults to \fBfalse\fR\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBgemfile\fR (\fBBUNDLE_GEMFILE\fR): The name of the file that bundler should use as the \fBGemfile\fR\. This location of this file also sets the root of the project, which is used to resolve relative paths in the \fBGemfile\fR, among other things\. By default, bundler will search up from the current working directory until it finds a \fBGemfile\fR\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBssl_ca_cert\fR (\fBBUNDLE_SSL_CA_CERT\fR): Path to a designated CA certificate file or folder containing multiple certificates for trusted CAs in PEM format\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBssl_client_cert\fR (\fBBUNDLE_SSL_CLIENT_CERT\fR): Path to a designated file containing a X\.509 client certificate and key in PEM format\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBcache_path\fR (\fBBUNDLE_CACHE_PATH\fR): The directory that bundler will place cached gems in when running \fBbundle package\fR, and that bundler will look in when installing gems\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBdisable_multisource\fR (\fBBUNDLE_DISABLE_MULTISOURCE\fR): When set, Gemfiles containing multiple sources will produce errors instead of warnings\. Use \fBbundle config \-\-delete disable_multisource\fR to unset\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBignore_messages\fR (\fBBUNDLE_IGNORE_MESSAGES\fR): When set, no post install messages will be printed\. To silence a single gem, use dot notation like \fBignore_messages\.httparty true\fR\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBretry\fR (\fBBUNDLE_RETRY\fR): The number of times to retry failed network requests\. Defaults to \fB3\fR\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBredirect\fR (\fBBUNDLE_REDIRECT\fR): The number of redirects allowed for network requests\. Defaults to \fB5\fR\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBtimeout\fR (\fBBUNDLE_TIMEOUT\fR): The seconds allowed before timing out for network requests\. Defaults to \fB10\fR\.
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
In general, you should set these settings per\-application by using the applicable flag to the bundle install(1) \fIbundle\-install\.1\.html\fR or bundle package(1) \fIbundle\-package\.1\.html\fR command\.
.
.P
You can set them globally either via environment variables or \fBbundle config\fR, whichever is preferable for your setup\. If you use both, environment variables will take preference over global settings\.
.
.SH "LOCAL GIT REPOS"
Bundler also allows you to work against a git repository locally instead of using the remote version\. This can be achieved by setting up a local override:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

bundle config local\.GEM_NAME /path/to/local/git/repository
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
For example, in order to use a local Rack repository, a developer could call:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

bundle config local\.rack ~/Work/git/rack
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
Now instead of checking out the remote git repository, the local override will be used\. Similar to a path source, every time the local git repository change, changes will be automatically picked up by Bundler\. This means a commit in the local git repo will update the revision in the \fBGemfile\.lock\fR to the local git repo revision\. This requires the same attention as git submodules\. Before pushing to the remote, you need to ensure the local override was pushed, otherwise you may point to a commit that only exists in your local machine\.
.
.P
Bundler does many checks to ensure a developer won\'t work with invalid references\. Particularly, we force a developer to specify a branch in the \fBGemfile\fR in order to use this feature\. If the branch specified in the \fBGemfile\fR and the current branch in the local git repository do not match, Bundler will abort\. This ensures that a developer is always working against the correct branches, and prevents accidental locking to a different branch\.
.
.P
Finally, Bundler also ensures that the current revision in the \fBGemfile\.lock\fR exists in the local git repository\. By doing this, Bundler forces you to fetch the latest changes in the remotes\.
.
.SH "MIRRORS OF GEM SOURCES"
Bundler supports overriding gem sources with mirrors\. This allows you to configure rubygems\.org as the gem source in your Gemfile while still using your mirror to fetch gems\.
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

bundle config mirror\.SOURCE_URL MIRROR_URL
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
For example, to use a mirror of rubygems\.org hosted at
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

bundle config mirror\.http://rubygems\.org http://rubygems\-mirror\.org
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.SH "CREDENTIALS FOR GEM SOURCES"
Bundler allows you to configure credentials for any gem source, which allows you to avoid putting secrets into your Gemfile\.
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

bundle config SOURCE_HOSTNAME USERNAME:PASSWORD
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
For example, to save the credentials of user \fBclaudette\fR for the gem source at \fBgems\.longerous\.com\fR, you would run:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

bundle config gems\.longerous\.com claudette:s00pers3krit
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
Or you can set the credentials as an environment variable like this:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

export BUNDLE_GEMS__LONGEROUS__COM="claudette:s00pers3krit"
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
