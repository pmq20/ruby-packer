.Sh NAME
.Nm PEM_bytes_read_bio
.Nd read a PEM-encoded data structure from a BIO
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In openssl/pem.h
.Ft int
.Fo PEM_bytes_read_bio
.Fa "unsigned char **pdata"
.Fa "long *plen"
.Fa "char **pnm"
.Fa "const char *name"
.Fa "BIO *bp"
.Fa "pem_password_cb *cb"
.Fa "void *u"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn PEM_bytes_read_bio
reads PEM-formatted (RFC 1421) data from the BIO
.Fa bp
for the data type given in
.Fa name
(RSA PRIVATE KEY, CERTIFICATE, etc.).
If multiple PEM-encoded data structures are present in the same stream,
.Fn PEM_bytes_read_bio
will skip non-matching data types and continue reading.
Non-PEM data present in the stream may cause an error.
.Pp
The PEM header may indicate that the following data is encrypted; if so,
the data will be decrypted, waiting on user input to supply a passphrase
if needed.
The password callback
.Fa cb
and rock
.Fa u
are used to obtain the decryption passphrase, if applicable.
.Pp
Some data types have compatibility aliases, such as a file containing
X509 CERTIFICATE matching a request for the deprecated type CERTIFICATE.
The actual type indicated by the file is returned in
.Em *pnm
if
.Fa pnm
is
.Pf non- Dv NULL .
The caller must free the storage pointed to by
.Em *pnm .
.Pp
The returned data is the DER-encoded form of the requested type, in
.Em *pdata
with length
.Em *plen .
The caller must free the storage pointed to by
.Em *pdata .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn PEM_bytes_read_bio
returns 1 for success or 0 for failure.
