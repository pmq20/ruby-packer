.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions decode and encode ASN.1 sequences and sets.
For details about the semantics, examples, caveats, and bugs, see
.Xr ASN1_item_d2i 3 .
.Pp
The type
.Vt ASN1_SEQUENCE_ANY
is defined as
.Vt STACK_OF(ASN1_TYPE) .
Whether such an object represents a sequence or a set is not stored
in the object itself but needs to be remembered separately.
.Pp
Like for
.Xr d2i_ASN1_TYPE 3
and
.Xr i2d_ASN1_TYPE 3 ,
the type of the individual values contained in the sequence or set
is not specified when calling the functions.
It might vary among the members, and it is stored together with
each value in each
.Vt ASN1_TYPE
object contained in the sequence or set.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn d2i_ASN1_SEQUENCE_ANY
returns an
.Vt ASN1_SEQUENCE_ANY
object or
.Dv NULL
if an error occurs.
.Pp
.Fn i2d_ASN1_SEQUENCE_ANY
returns the number of bytes written or a negative value if an error
occurs.
