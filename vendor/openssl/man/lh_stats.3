.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Vt LHASH
structure records statistics about most aspects of accessing the hash
table.
.Pp
.Fn lh_stats
prints out statistics on the size of the hash table, how many entries
are in it, and the number and result of calls to the routines in this
library.
.Pp
.Fn lh_node_stats
prints the number of entries for each 'bucket' in the hash table.
.Pp
.Fn lh_node_usage_stats
prints out a short summary of the state of the hash table.
It prints the 'load' and the 'actual load'.
The load is the average number of data items per 'bucket' in the hash
table.
The 'actual load' is the average number of items per 'bucket', but only
for buckets which contain entries.
So the 'actual load' is the average number of searches that will need to
find an item in the hash table, while the 'load' is the average number
that will be done to record a miss.
.Pp
.Fn lh_stats_bio ,
.Fn lh_node_stats_bio ,
and
.Fn lh_node_usage_stats_bio
are the same as the above, except that the output goes to a
.Vt BIO .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
These functions do not return values.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr BIO_new 3 ,
.Xr lh_new 3
.Sh HISTORY
These functions are available in all versions of SSLeay and OpenSSL.
.Sh AUTHORS
.An Eric Young
