.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn BIO_ctrl ,
.Fn BIO_callback_ctrl ,
.Fn BIO_ptr_ctrl ,
and
.Fn BIO_int_ctrl
are BIO "control" operations taking arguments of various types.
These functions are not normally called directly -
various macros are used instead.
The standard macros are described below.
Macros specific to a particular type of BIO
are described in the specific BIO's manual page
as well as any special features of the standard calls.
.Pp
.Fn BIO_reset
typically resets a BIO to some initial state.
In the case of file related BIOs, for example,
it rewinds the file pointer to the start of the file.
.Pp
.Fn BIO_seek
resets a file related BIO's (that is file descriptor and
FILE BIOs) file position pointer to
.Fa ofs
bytes from start of file.
.Pp
.Fn BIO_tell
returns the current file position of a file related BIO.
.Pp
.Fn BIO_flush
normally writes out any internally buffered data.
In some cases it is used to signal EOF and that no more data will be written.
.Pp
.Fn BIO_eof
returns 1 if the BIO has read EOF.
The precise meaning of "EOF" varies according to the BIO type.
.Pp
.Fn BIO_set_close
sets the BIO
.Fa b
close flag to
.Fa flag .
.Fa flag
can take the value
.Dv BIO_CLOSE
or
.Dv BIO_NOCLOSE .
Typically
.Dv BIO_CLOSE
is used in a source/sink BIO to indicate that the underlying I/O stream
should be closed when the BIO is freed.
.Pp
.Fn BIO_get_close
returns the BIO's close flag.
.Pp
.Fn BIO_pending ,
.Fn BIO_ctrl_pending ,
.Fn BIO_wpending ,
and
.Fn BIO_ctrl_wpending
return the number of pending characters in the BIO's read and write buffers.
Not all BIOs support these calls.
.Fn BIO_ctrl_pending
and
.Fn BIO_ctrl_wpending
return a
.Vt size_t
type and are functions.
.Fn BIO_pending
and
.Fn BIO_wpending
are macros which call
.Fn BIO_ctrl .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn BIO_reset
normally returns 1 for success and 0 or -1 for failure.
File BIOs are an exception, returning 0 for success and -1 for failure.
.Pp
.Fn BIO_seek
and
.Fn BIO_tell
both return the current file position on success
and -1 for failure, except file BIOs which for
.Fn BIO_seek
always return 0 for success and -1 for failure.
.Pp
.Fn BIO_flush
returns 1 for success and 0 or -1 for failure.
.Pp
.Fn BIO_eof
returns 1 if EOF has been reached or 0 otherwise.
.Pp
.Fn BIO_set_close
always returns 1.
.Pp
.Fn BIO_get_close
returns the close flag value
.Dv BIO_CLOSE
or
.Dv BIO_NOCLOSE .
.Pp
.Fn BIO_pending ,
.Fn BIO_ctrl_pending ,
.Fn BIO_wpending ,
and
.Fn BIO_ctrl_wpending
return the amount of pending data.
.Sh NOTES
Because it can write data,
.Fn BIO_flush
may return 0 or -1 indicating that the call should be retried later
in a similar manner to
.Xr BIO_write 3 .
The
.Xr BIO_should_retry 3
call should be used and appropriate action taken if the call fails.
.Pp
The return values of
.Fn BIO_pending
and
.Fn BIO_wpending
may not reliably determine the amount of pending data in all cases.
For example in the case of a file BIO some data may be available in the
.Vt FILE
structure's internal buffers but it is not possible
to determine this in a portable way.
For other types of BIO they may not be supported.
.Pp
If they do not internally handle a particular
.Fn BIO_ctrl
operation, filter BIOs usually pass the operation
to the next BIO in the chain.
This often means there is no need to locate the required BIO for
a particular operation: it can be called on a chain and it will
be automatically passed to the relevant BIO.
However this can cause unexpected results.
For example no current filter BIOs implement
.Fn BIO_seek ,
but this may still succeed if the chain ends
in a FILE or file descriptor BIO.
.Pp
Source/sink BIOs return an 0 if they do not recognize the
.Fn BIO_ctrl
operation.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr BIO_new 3
.Sh BUGS
Some of the return values are ambiguous and care should be taken.
In particular a return value of 0 can be returned if an operation
is not supported, if an error occurred, if EOF has not been reached
and in the case of
.Fn BIO_seek
on a file BIO for a successful operation.
