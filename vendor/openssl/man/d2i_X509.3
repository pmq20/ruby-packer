.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions decode and encode X.509 certificates
and some of their substructures.
For details about the semantics, examples, caveats, and bugs, see
.Xr ASN1_item_d2i 3 .
.Pp
.Fn d2i_X509
and
.Fn i2d_X509
decode and encode an ASN.1
.Vt Certificate
structure defined in RFC 5280 section 4.1.
.Pp
.Fn d2i_X509_bio ,
.Fn d2i_X509_fp ,
.Fn i2d_X509_bio ,
and
.Fn i2d_X509_fp
are similar except that they decode or encode using a
.Vt BIO
or
.Vt FILE
pointer.
.Pp
.Fn d2i_X509_AUX
is similar to
.Fn d2i_X509 ,
but the input is expected to consist of an X.509 certificate followed
by auxiliary trust information.
This is used by the PEM routines to read TRUSTED CERTIFICATE objects.
This function should not be called on untrusted input.
.Pp
.Fn i2d_X509_AUX
is similar to
.Fn i2d_X509 ,
but the encoded output contains both the certificate and any auxiliary
trust information.
This is used by the PEM routines to write TRUSTED CERTIFICATE objects.
Note that this is a non-standard OpenSSL-specific data format.
.Pp
.Fn d2i_X509_CERT_AUX
and
.Fn i2d_X509_CERT_AUX
decode and encode optional non-standard auxiliary data appended to
a certificate, for example friendly alias names and trust data.
.Pp
.Fn d2i_X509_CINF
and
.Fn i2d_X509_CINF
decode and encode an ASN.1
.Vt TBSCertificate
structure defined in RFC 5280 section 4.1.
.Pp
.Fn d2i_X509_VAL
and
.Fn i2d_X509_VAL
decode and encode an ASN.1
.Vt Validity
structure defined in RFC 5280 section 4.1.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn d2i_X509 ,
.Fn d2i_X509_bio ,
.Fn d2i_X509_fp ,
and
.Fn d2i_X509_AUX
return a valid
.Vt X509
structure or
.Dv NULL
if an error occurs.
.Pp
.Fn d2i_X509_CERT_AUX ,
.Fn d2i_X509_CINF ,
and
.Fn d2i_X509_VAL
return an
.Vt X509_CERT_AUX ,
.Vt X509_CINF ,
or
.Vt X509_VAL
object, respectively, or
.Dv NULL
if an error occurs.
.Pp
.Fn i2d_X509 ,
.Fn i2d_X509_AUX ,
.Fn i2d_X509_CERT_AUX ,
.Fn i2d_X509_CINF ,
and
.Fn i2d_X509_VAL
return the number of bytes successfully encoded or a negative value
if an error occurs.
.Pp
.Fn i2d_X509_bio
and
.Fn i2d_X509_fp
return 1 for success or 0 if an error occurs.
.Pp
For all functions, the error code can be obtained by
.Xr ERR_get_error 3 .
