.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions decode and encode X.501
.Vt Name
objects using DER format.
For details about the semantics, examples, caveats, and bugs, see
.Xr ASN1_item_d2i 3 .
.Pp
.Fn d2i_X509_NAME
and
.Fn i2d_X509_NAME
decode and encode an ASN.1
.Vt Name
structure defined in RFC 5280 section 4.1.2.4.
.Pp
.Fn X509_NAME_dup
copies
.Fa val_in
by calling
.Fn i2d_X509_NAME
and
.Fn d2i_X509_NAME .
.Pp
.Fn X509_NAME_hash
calculates a
.Xr SHA1 3
hash of the DER-encoded form of the name
.Pf * Fa val_in .
It is for example used by
.Xr X509_LOOKUP_hash_dir 3
to locate certificate files in the file system.
.Pp
.Fn d2i_X509_NAME_ENTRY
and
.Fn i2d_X509_NAME_ENTRY
decode and encode an ASN.1
.Vt RelativeDistinguishedName
structure defined in RFC 5280 section 4.1.2.4.
.Pp
.Fn X509_NAME_ENTRY_dup
copies
.Fa val_in
by calling
.Fn i2d_X509_NAME_ENTRY
and
.Fn d2i_X509_NAME_ENTRY .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn d2i_X509_NAME
and
.Fn X509_NAME_dup
return the new
.Vt X509_NAME
object or
.Dv NULL
if an error occurs.
.Pp
.Fn X509_NAME_hash
returns the hash value or 0 if an error occurs.
.Pp
.Fn d2i_X509_NAME_ENTRY
and
.Fn X509_NAME_ENTRY_dup
return the new
.Vt X509_NAME_ENTRY
object or
.Dv NULL
if an error occurs.
.Pp
.Fn i2d_X509_NAME
and
.Fn i2d_X509_NAME_ENTRY
return the number of bytes successfully encoded or a negative value
if an error occurs.
