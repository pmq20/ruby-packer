.Sh DESCRIPTION
RIPEMD-160 is a cryptographic hash function with a 160-bit output.
.Pp
.Fn RIPEMD160
computes the RIPEMD-160 message digest of the
.Fa n
bytes at
.Fa d
and places it in
.Fa md ,
which must have space for
.Dv RIPEMD160_DIGEST_LENGTH
== 20 bytes of output.
If
.Fa md
is
.Dv NULL ,
the digest is placed in a static array.
.Pp
The following functions may be used if the message is not completely
stored in memory:
.Pp
.Fn RIPEMD160_Init
initializes a
.Vt RIPEMD160_CTX
structure.
.Pp
.Fn RIPEMD160_Update
can be called repeatedly with chunks of the message to be hashed
.Pq Fa len No bytes at Fa data .
.Pp
.Fn RIPEMD160_Final
places the message digest in
.Fa md ,
which must have space for
.Dv RIPEMD160_DIGEST_LENGTH
== 20 bytes of output,
and erases the
.Vt RIPEMD160_CTX .
.Pp
Applications should use the higher level functions
.Xr EVP_DigestInit 3
etc. instead of calling the hash functions directly.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn RIPEMD160
returns a pointer to the hash value.
.Pp
.Fn RIPEMD160_Init ,
.Fn RIPEMD160_Update ,
and
.Fn RIPEMD160_Final
return 1 for success or 0 otherwise.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr EVP_DigestInit 3 ,
.Xr HMAC 3
.Sh STANDARDS
ISO/IEC 10118-3 (draft) (??)
.Sh HISTORY
.Fn RIPEMD160 ,
.Fn RIPEMD160_Init ,
.Fn RIPEMD160_Update ,
and
.Fn RIPEMD160_Final
are available since SSLeay 0.9.0.
