.Sh DESCRIPTION
The DES library contained a few routines to prompt for passwords.
These aren't necessarily dependent on DES, and have therefore become
part of the UI compatibility library.
.Pp
.Fn des_read_pw
writes the string specified by
.Fa prompt
to standard output, turns echo off, and reads an input string from the
terminal.
The string is returned in
.Fa buf ,
which must have space for at least
.Fa length
bytes.
If
.Fa verify
is set, the user is asked for the password twice and unless the two
copies match, an error is returned.
The second password is stored in
.Fa buff ,
which must therefore also be at least
.Fa length
bytes.
A return code of -1 indicates a system error, 1 failure due to use
interaction, and 0 is success.
.Pp
.Fn des_read_pw_string
is a variant of
.Fn des_read_pw
that provides a buffer if
.Fa verify
is set.
It is available in the MIT Kerberos library as well.
If
.Fa length
exceeds
.Dv BUFSIZ ,
.Fn des_read_pw_string
uses
.Dv BUFSIZ .
.Pp
.Fn EVP_read_pw_string
is functionally similar to
.Fn des_read_pw_string .
