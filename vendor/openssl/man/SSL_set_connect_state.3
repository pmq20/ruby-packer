.Dt SSL_SET_CONNECT_STATE 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm SSL_set_connect_state ,
.Nm SSL_set_accept_state
.Nd prepare SSL object to work in client or server mode
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In openssl/ssl.h
.Ft void
.Fn SSL_set_connect_state "SSL *ssl"
.Ft void
.Fn SSL_set_accept_state "SSL *ssl"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn SSL_set_connect_state
sets
.Fa ssl
to work in client mode.
.Pp
.Fn SSL_set_accept_state
sets
.Fa ssl
to work in server mode.
.Pp
When the
.Vt SSL_CTX
object was created with
.Xr SSL_CTX_new 3 ,
it was either assigned a dedicated client method, a dedicated server method, or
a generic method, that can be used for both client and server connections.
(The method might have been changed with
.Xr SSL_CTX_set_ssl_version 3
or
.Xr SSL_set_ssl_method 3 . )
.Pp
When beginning a new handshake, the SSL engine must know whether it must call
the connect (client) or accept (server) routines.
Even though it may be clear from the method chosen whether client or server
mode was requested, the handshake routines must be explicitly set.
.Pp
When using the
.Xr SSL_connect 3
or
.Xr SSL_accept 3
routines, the correct handshake routines are automatically set.
When performing a transparent negotiation using
.Xr SSL_write 3
or
.Xr SSL_read 3 ,
the handshake routines must be explicitly set in advance using either
.Fn SSL_set_connect_state
or
.Fn SSL_set_accept_state .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn SSL_set_connect_state
and
.Fn SSL_set_accept_state
do not return diagnostic information.
