.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn SSL_copy_session_id
copies the following data from
.Fa from
to
.Fa to :
.Bl -dash
.It
the pointer to the
.Vt SSL_SESSION
object, incrementing its reference count by 1
.It
the pointer to the
.Vt SSL_METHOD
object; if that changes the method, protocol-specific data is
reinitialized
.It
the pointer to the
.Vt CERT
object, incrementing its reference count by 1
.It
the session ID context
.El

This function is used internally by
.Xr SSL_dup 3
and by
.Xr BIO_ssl_copy_session_id 3 .

.Fn SSL_copy_session_id
is available in all versions of OpenSSL.
.Sh BUGS
Failures of
.Xr SSL_set_session 3 ,
.Xr SSL_set_session_id_context 3 ,
.Xr CRYPTO_add 3 ,
and reinitialization of protocol-specific data are silently ignored
and may leave
.Fa to
in an invalid or inconsistent state.
An improved version reporting failure is available in OpenSSL 1.1.0.
