.Dt EVP_PKEY_NEW 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm EVP_PKEY_new ,
.Nm EVP_PKEY_free
.Nd private key allocation functions
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In openssl/evp.h
.Ft EVP_PKEY *
.Fn EVP_PKEY_new void
.Ft void
.Fo EVP_PKEY_free
.Fa "EVP_PKEY *key"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Vt EVP_PKEY
structure is used by various OpenSSL functions which require a general
private key without reference to any particular algorithm.
.Pp
The
.Fn EVP_PKEY_new
function allocates an empty
.Vt EVP_PKEY
structure.
To add a private key to it, use the functions described in
.Xr EVP_PKEY_set1_RSA 3 .
.Pp
.Fn EVP_PKEY_free
frees up the private key
.Fa key .
If
.Fa key
is a
.Dv NULL
pointer, no action occurs.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn EVP_PKEY_new
returns either the newly allocated
.Vt EVP_PKEY
structure or
.Dv NULL
if an error occurred.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr EVP_PKEY_set1_RSA 3
.Sh HISTORY
.Fn EVP_PKEY_new
and
.Fn EVP_PKEY_free
exist in all versions of OpenSSL.
