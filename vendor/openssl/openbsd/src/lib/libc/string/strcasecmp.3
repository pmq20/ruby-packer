.Sh NAME
.Nm strcasecmp ,
.Nm strncasecmp
.Nd compare strings, ignoring case
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In strings.h
.Ft int
.Fn strcasecmp "const char *s1" "const char *s2"
.Ft int
.Fn strncasecmp "const char *s1" "const char *s2" "size_t len"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn strcasecmp
and
.Fn strncasecmp
functions compare the NUL-terminated strings
.Fa s1
and
.Fa s2
and return an integer greater than, equal to, or less than 0,
according to whether
.Fa s1
is lexicographically greater than, equal to, or less than
.Fa s2
after translation of each corresponding character to lower-case.
The strings themselves are not modified.
The comparison is done using unsigned characters, so that
.Sq Li \e200
is greater than
.Ql \e0 .
.Pp
.Fn strncasecmp
compares at most
.Fa len
characters.
