.Sh NAME
.Nm strxfrm
.Nd transform a string under locale
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In string.h
.Ft size_t
.Fn strxfrm "char *dst" "const char *src" "size_t n"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The idea of
.Fn strxfrm
is to
.Dq un-localize
a string: the function transforms
.Ar src ,
storing the result in
.Ar dst ,
such that
.Xr strcmp 3
on transformed strings returns what
.Xr strcoll 3
on the original untransformed strings would return.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr bcmp 3 ,
.Xr memcmp 3 ,
.Xr setlocale 3 ,
.Xr strcasecmp 3 ,
.Xr strcmp 3 ,
.Xr strcoll 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn strxfrm
function conforms to
.St -ansiC .
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn strxfrm
function first appeared in
.Bx 4.3 Reno .
.Sh BUGS
Since locales are not fully implemented on
.Ox ,
.Fn strxfrm
just returns a copy of the original string.
